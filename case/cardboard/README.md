# Paperboard box

Use a roughly 1 mm thick cardboard. Cut it out as shown in `cardboard.svg`. Then follow the images regarding the box assembly.
Between `cardboard-3.jpg` and `cardboard-4.jpg`, assemble the ESP, display driver board and the display. Then gently push the display from inside the box through the display cutout.
Then roll the "Abstandshalter" together and place it inside the box such that it keeps the ESP from moving when plugging in the USB-C cable.
Afterwards, close the box.
